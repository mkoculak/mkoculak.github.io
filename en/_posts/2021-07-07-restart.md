# Re-start!

This is a second attepmt at starting this blog.

There is honestly nothing more iconic than people restarting their blogs after several years, while the first run lasted for a couple of notes (three in my case).

However, since the blog was dead from the beginning, this resurrection will happen without whitnesses (since nobody was really reading it). So there's nobody to judge. Also, no shame in trying.

### What now

I am reaching the last streach in my phd journey where I plan to do a fair amount of EEG analyses on mostly resting state data. I would like to document this experience in hopes it will help people that want to start with EEG and python.  
Keep fingers crossed it will last more than three posts! :)
