My name is <strong>Marcin</strong>.  
I am a Ph.D. student in Experimental Psychology Unit at the [Institute of Psychology JU](https://psychologia.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) and a member of [C-Lab - consciousness lab](http://c-lab.pl). My main scientific focus is on experimental consciousness studies with neuroimaging. I mostly work with EEG data, code experimental procedures and oversee the technical functioning of the lab.  
I am interested in everything related to processing of biological signals, data analysis and visualisation. After hours I code websites for scientific entities, teach students, or think of new side projects that I never finish. Would love to combine it someday with my fascination with robots and space.  

If I am not at the computer, I am probably sleeping.

###### **Content of the website**
Most of materials here will be about programming in Python or EEG data analysis. Through years I have amassed many didactic materials and useful scripts, which I would like to organise here. If I ever finish any side project, I will boast about it here for sure. &#x1f643;
